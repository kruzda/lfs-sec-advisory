    <h1>LFS and BLFS Security Advisories from September 2020 onwards</h1>

    <p>LFS has not reported Security Vulnerabilities in the Errata, at least
    recently, but tickets for some new versions have had details.</p>

    <p>BLFS used to keep details of Security Vulnerabilities in the Errata,
    mostly updating them to point to the latest version in the development book
    and updating the brief text if a subsequent vulnerability was reported.</p>

    <p><em>This page is a consolidated list for both LFS and BLFS.</em></p>

    <p>This list contains summary details and links to upstreams or CVEs where
    available. Please note that vulnerabilities to package versions before those
    in our 10.0 releases are not noted, so if you are running a version of BLFS
    before 10.0 you should check the Errata for past releases as well as
    monitoring the items here.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">This page is ordered like the Changelog of the
    books, with newest items first.</p>

    <p>The severity ratings are best estimates unless either upstream
    or NVD has assigned a rating. If no other analysis is available,
    High will usually be assumed and similarly if a crash can be triggered
    LFS and BLFS will normally rate that as High. If in doubt, read the links.</p>

    <!-- Editors: Commented entry to copy, and reminder about patches

    If there is a CVE, https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-YYYY-NNNN
    shows severities.  If not, cve.mitre.org may show some details.
    However, for fresh releases the number will probably be marked as
    'Reserved'. If upstream assigns a severity (often higher than nvd)
    go with that. If in doubt, usually default to High.

    Start the id with the latest book version, then next number - reset number
    to 1 after we release.

    <p>In <a
    href="https://tug.org/texlive/bugs.html">texlive_bugs (Known issues in TeX Live 2023)</a>
    all users of the luatex programs are advised to update to v1.17.0 (and for the
    binary, that includes users of ConTeXt which uses the luametatex binary: in
    texlive-source we only support ConTeXt using the mkiv backend - that also needs
    a fix). The issue has been described as "obscure ways to work around some security
    features", no further details are available.</p>
    <p>Users of install-tl-unx who have installed lualatex should check the version
    using 'lualatex --version' and use tlmgr to update if the version is less than
    1.17.0.</p>
    <p>To fix this using texlive-sourcei2023 reinstall using the security-fixes-1
    patch and applying a sed to mtxrun.lua (if you use ConTeXt) following the
    instructions from 
    <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/pst/texlive.html">texlive (sysv)</a> or
    <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/pst/texlive.html">texlive (systemd)</a>.

    <h4>11.3 022 WebKitGTK+   Date: 2023-04-23  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In WebKitGTK+-2.40.1, six security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for remote code execution, remotely exploitable denial of service,
    Same Origin Policy bypass, and sensitive user information tracking. One of
    these vulnerabilities resulted in emergency updates from Apple and is known
    to be actively exploited, and can be triggered through malicious
    advertisements on web pages or other crafted web content. It's recommended
    that you update WebKitGTK+ immediately to protect yourself and your system.

    -DUSE_GTK4=OFF. If you do not want to install the new libavif package
    and it's dependency, pass -DUSE_AVIF=OFF.</p>
    <p>We are currently aware of reports that this package fails to run properly
    when used on Intel GPUs between Skylake and Coffee Lake. If you have one of
    these GPUs, please wait until the next release of WebKitGTK+.</p>

    <h4>11.3 021 Wireshark    Date: 2023-04-13  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In Wireshark-4.0.5, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture files.
    These can occur when using RPCoRDMA packets, LISP packets, or GQUIC packets.
    Two of these vulnerabilities cause a crash, and the other causes a huge loop
    that can run your system out of resources. If you're using RPCoRDMA, LISP,
    or GQUIC packets in your network, it's recommended to update Wireshark.

    <p>In libxml2-2.10.4, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    cause crashes. One of these is because hashing of empty dict strings wasn't
    deterministic, but the other two vulnerabilities are due to null pointer
    dereferences when using the xmlSchemeFixupComplexType and the
    xmlSchemaCheckCOSSTDerivedOK functions. Note that only two of these

    proof of concept for this vulnerability is public, and it is known to be
    exploited. The vulnerability was fixed with ghostscript-10.01.1, but was
    not known to be part of this update until a posting was released to
    oss-security on 04-13-2023 making it public. This vulnerability is called
    "Shell in the Ghost", and is due to a buffer overflow. It is imperative that
    you update ghostscript on all systems which have it installed immediately.

    <p>In Thunderbird-102.10.0, several security vulnerabilities were fixed that
    could allow for user confusion/spoofing attacks, potentially exploitable
    crashes, memory corruption, denial of service, security control bypasses
    (revocation status of S/MIME certificates were not checked), user interface
    hangs, remote code execution through download reflection and mishandling of
    .desktop files on Linux systems, and arbitrary code execution. Updating
    Thunderbird is highly recommended, and is crucial if you are using S/MIME

    <p>In Samba-4.18.1, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for unauthorized attribute deletion, password resets where the new
    password is transmitted in plaintext, and for confidential attribute
    disclosure. Note that all three of these vulnerabilities require LDAP/AD DC
    to exploit, and while this isn't the default configuration of Samba in BLFS,
    some users are known to use it. The most serious vulnerability of the three
    is the confidential attribute disclosure. It has been discovered to be used
    to exfiltrate TPM owner passwords, certificate secret keys, and Bitlocker
    recovery keys. For users who have Active Directory Domain Controllers using
    Samba and use these features on Windows clients, the Samba team states that
    you should assume that this information has been compromised, and steps
    should be made to ensure that data that may have been leaked from
    confidential or otherwise access-controlled attributes is no longer useful.
    For example, drives should be re-encrypted if they are using BitLocker,
    TPM passwords should be changed, certificates should be re-issued, etc.
    Note that a successful exploitation will not show anything in the logs
    unless the logs are set to a level of 10 (which is highly verbose).
    If you are using Samba as an AD DC, you should take immediate action. In
    addition to applying this update, you will need to take actions to protect
    any data that may have been potentially compromised. See the information on
    CVE-2023-0614 for more information.

    for authentication bypasses, remotely exploitable crashes, content filtering
    circumvention or arbitrary file writes, and command injection. These
    vulnerabilities occur due to improper reusage of connections when using

    occurs when using HSTS, and the command injection occurs whenever using the

    writes occur when using SFTP, and happen due to a discrepancy when resolving
    the ~ (tilde) character. It's important to update cURL if you're using it to

    <p>In httpd-2.4.56, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for HTTP Request Smuggling attacks. These can occur on servers where
    the mod_proxy and mod_rewrite modules are enabled, or where mod_proxy_uwsgi
    is enabled. Request splitting or smuggling could result in bypass of access
    controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin
    servers, and for cache poisoning. Special characters in the origin response
    header can truncate/split the response forwarded to the client. Configurations
    are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule
    or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the
    user supplied request-target (URL) data, and it is re-inserted into the
    proxied request-target using variable substitution. You should update
    Apache HTTPD if you are using the mod_proxy and mod_rewrite modules in
    combination, or if you are using the mod_proxy_uwsgi module.

    <p>In Epiphany-43.1, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for untrusted web content to trick user into exfiltrating passwords. This
    occurs because autofill occured in sandboxed contexts, and was worked
    around by disabling the password manager entirely when running inside of a

    reported that it also impacts Safari, Bitwarden, and Dash Lane, and allows
    for credentials to be automatically filled into untrusted pages without
    the master password, and allows for complete account compromise for any
    users who use the password management functionality. A proof-of-concept

    <h4>11.2 099 cURL                   Date: 2023-02-21  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In cURL-7.88.1, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for denial of service and HSTS bypass. The denial of service issue
    occurs when transferring data which is compressed. The problem happens when
    data is compressed multiple times, since cURL supports chained HTTP
    compression algorithms. Due to a logic flaw, it was possible for malicious
    servers to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply
    by using many headers. This can cause a "malloc bomb", where cURL spends
    enormous amounts of heap memory and eventually running out of system
    resources. In the case of the two HSTS bypass vulnerabilities, these
    vulnerabilities occur due to cURL's cache saving behaving incorrectly when
    using multiple URLs in parallel, and the other vulnerability allows for
    HSTS bypass because cURL's HSTS mechanism would ignore subsequent transfers
    when done on the same command line (due to the state not being properly
    carried on.). Note that the last HSTS vulnerability only affects the cURL
    command line utility, and not the library.

    the 'git apply' command (and the path outside the working tree will be
    overwritten as long as that user has the authority to do so), and the other
    relies off the usage of submodules. Note that the data exfiltration
    vulnerability can be worked around by not cloning repositories with
    '--recurse-submodules', and running 'git submodule update' at each layer of
    a repository using submodules. When doing this, it's also important
    to inspect all .gitmodules files to ensure that it does not contain
    suspicious module URLs.

    <p>In PostgreSQL-15.2, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for an unauthenticated server to send an unterminated string during the
    establishment of Kerberos transport encryption. When this occurs, and a
    libpq client application has a Kerberos credential cache setup that doesn't
    explicitly disable the gssencmode option, a server can cause libpq to
    over-read and report an error message containing uninitialized bytes from
    and following it's receive buffer. If the caller somehow makes that
    message accessible to the attacker, it'll achieve a disclosure of over-read
    bytes. It has not been confirmed that a crash or leakage of confidential
    information can be achieved. It is important that you update PostgreSQL
    if you are using Kerberos transport encryption in your configuration.
    Alternatively, you can disable the gssencmode option as a workaround on
    any clients. Note that no dump/restore is required if upgrading from
    another version in the 15 series, and 14.7 has been released for
    PostgreSQL-14 users.

    <p>In OpenSSL-3.0.8, eight security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for remotely exploitable denial of service, arbitrary reading of
    memory (including the ability to harvest private keys), plaintext data
    recovery, and side channel attacks. These vulnerabilities occur when
    performing PKCS7 data verification, validating DSA public keys, decrypting
    RSA data, using X.509 certificates, and when using various different
    OpenSSL API functions. Since OpenSSL is used in a variety of different
    contexts and applications for cryptography operations, it is imperative
    that you update OpenSSL on all affected systems immediately. For older
    systems which do not use OpenSSL-3 (LFS 11.1 for example), you should
    upgrade to 1.1.1t instead of 3.0.8.

    <p>In Linux-6.1.9 (and 5.15.91), three security vulnerabilities were fixed
    that could allow for remotely exploitable system crashes, leakage of
    stack/heap addresses, local privilege escalation, and arbitrary code
    execution. These vulnerabilities existed in the Netfilter subsystem (buffer
    overflow), IPv6 subsystem (NULL pointer dereference in
    rawv6_push_pending_frames), and the kernel's NTFS3 driver (NULL pointer
    dereference). The IPv6 vulnerability can be exploited during normal system
    usage, and the NTFS vulnerability requires the user to mount a filesystem
    with NTFS Extended Attributes.
    The most serious of these vulnerabilities is the Netfilter buffer overflow,
    and a mitigation is possible by running
    "sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 0". Note
    that this will break desktop environments and any other applications which
    use User Namespaces though, such as QtWebEngine.

    <p>In systemd-246 and higher, a security vulnerability was discovered that
    could allow for a local information leak and for privilege escalation. This
    vulnerability exists in the systemd-coredump program, and is caused by
    systemd-coredump not respecting the fs.suid_dumpable kernel setting. The
    BLFS team has developed a patch for systemd-251 and systemd-252 that fixes
    this vulnerability. Note that this vulnerability theoretically could be
    exploited any time an application crashes, and can even be exploited by
    users who intentionally crash programs (such as the 'su' command). There is
    a proof-of-concept available publicly that allows for the root user's
    password hash to be leaked through the usage of the 'su' command by an
    unprivileged user. If you do not wish to patch systemd, a workaround
    would be to set the fs.suid_dumpable flag to 0, using the following
    command: "sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0", but note that you will be
    unable to debug application crashes from other users (including from root).

    Vulnerability" and "Netlogon RPC Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability"
    disclosed on November 8th, 2022. It was later found that these
    vulnerabilities allow for privilege escalation in the same way within Samba.
    Three of the vulnerabilities (which are related to Kerberos) require the
    system to be in an Active Directory domain, or Samba running in AD DC mode.
    However, the Netlogon vulnerability affects all configurations of Samba.
    Note that this update also fixes support for connecting to (and from)
    Microsoft Windows 11 22H2 systems, which could previously cause Samba
    to crash.

    <p>In WebKitGTK+-2.38.2, five security vulnerabilities were fixed that
    could allow for arbitrary code execution, remote code execution, disclosure
    of internal states from the application, user interface spoofing, and
    disclosure of sensitive user information (such as saved passwords). These
    vulnerabilities were resolved with improved boundary checking, state

    <p>In sysstat-12.6.1, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for remote code execution when using the sysstat utilities. This occurs due
    to a size_t overflow in the shared code between all of the utilities. The

    <p>In OpenSSL-3.0.7, three security vulnerabilites were fixed that could
    allow for remote code execution and denial of service. Note that one of
    these vulnerabilities were fixed in OpenSSL-3.0.6, but that version was
    withdrawn shortly after it was released. In the case of the remote code
    execution, an attacker can craft a malicious email address which will
    overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack, which guarantees
    denial-of-service and potentially also causes remote code execution. One
    of these vulnerabilities is exploitable by a crafted email address which
    has several '.' (dots) in them. One of the vulnerabilities also allows for
    NULL encryption when using a custom cipher, but this is uncommon and no
    packages in LFS or BLFS use this feature. Note that any of these
    vulnerabilities can be triggered by a TLS client connecting to a malicious
    server, and in the case of a TLS server, it's triggered when a malicious
    client connects after authentication. One of the most common mechanisms
    reported so far is through sending and receiving email, due to the
    vulnerabilities being in the X.509 certificate verification code, which is
    commonly used for S/MIME. These vulnerabilities were originally rated as
    Critical by upstream, but were later downgraded to High. Update to

    <p>In cURL-7.86.0, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for an application to send wrong data or use memory after it's been
    freed in certain circumstances, for a denial of service when using a .netrc
    file, and for applications to use HTTP instead of HTTPS by bypassing HSTS

    behavior is due to a logic problem which occurs because libcurl may
    erroneously use the read callback to ask for data to send if the same handle
    was previously used to issue a 'PUT' request which used that callback.
    The denial of service when using a .netrc file occurs due to an
    out-of-bounds access whenever a file ends in a line with consecutive
    non-white space characters and no new-line. The HSTS bypass occurs when a
    given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced to their ASCII counterparts
    as part of the IDN conversion. The primary threat from this vulnerability
    is cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

    <p>In git-2.38.1, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow
    for remote code execution on servers where git repositories are stored, and
    for sensitive information to be exposed to a remote attacker. In the case
    of sensitive information leakage, this vulnerability can occur when a user
    runs a 'git clone' in a folder where symbolic links exist. It was
    originally thought that this exploit only worked on local clones, but it
    was later discovered that cloning a submodule with the '--recurse-submodules'
    command can achieve the same goal by having a symbolic link point to a file
    like '/etc/passwd' inside of the repository. The remote code execution
    vulnerability occurs in the 'git shell' program, which is used to implement
    Git's push/pull functionality over SSH. It occurs due to the function that
    splits command line arguments into an array improperly using an 'int' to
    represent the amount of entries in the array, which allows remote attackers
    to intentionally overflow the return value and cause arbitrary heap writes.
    The vulnerability then occurs when the resulting array is passed to
    'execv()'. Upgrade to git-2.38.1 immediately if you are using it on
    a server, or if you clone untrusted repositories.

    for a denial-of-service (infinite loop) and for cookie spoofing.
    The denial-of-service happens when the 'phar' command uncompresses
    'quines' gzip files because the uncompressor's code would recursively
    uncompress them. The cookie spoofing attack can be performed either over
    the network or locally, and allows an attacker to set a standard insecure

    <p>In BIND-9.18.7, six security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow
    for denial of service and arbitrary code execution. These occur due to
    processing large delegations, buffer overreads in statistics channel code,
    memory leaks in code handling Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, memory leaks
    when processing ECDSA and EDDSA keys in DNSSEC, and crashes when processing
    stale caches. Note that the vulnerability when processing large delegations
    will also cause extremely degraded performance. These vulnerabilities only
    affect the server, not the client utilities.

    <p>In Thunderbird-102.2.1, several security vulnerabilities were fixed that
    could allow for leakage of sensitive information, objects to be loaded and
    processed unexpectedly, unauthorized network requests, and denial-of-service
    attacks. The leakage of sensitive information will occur when composing a
    reply to an HTML email with a 'META' refresh tag contained within, if the
    meta tag has a 'refresh' attribute and if the tag contains a URL.
    Thunderbird then starts a network request that URL and processes any
    JavaScript that is located within the email as a result (or from the URL),
    and executes it in the context of the message compose document.
    The JavaScript code could allow for an unauthorized read or modification of
    the contents of the email, and could also decrypt mails. The contents can
    then be transmitted to the network, with it being sent to the URL in the
    meta tag or to another URL depending on the JavaScript in use.
    In the case of remote content not being blocked and iframe elements
    triggering network requests, these occur whenever a user receives an HTML
    email. The denial-of-service attack can occur when connected to a network
    using the Matrix chat protocol, and can cause temporary corrpution. Update
    to Thunderbird-102.2.1 immediately.

    <p>In intel-microcode-20220809, a hardware vulnerability was fixed.
    When the interrupt controller (APIC) operates in xAPIC (also known as
    "legacy") mode, the APIC configuration registers are exposed through a
    memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) page.  An attacker able to execute code on a
    target CPU can perform an unaligned read from the MMIO page, then the
    vulnerability may cause the APIC to return stale data from previous
    requests made by the same processor core to the same configuration
    page, causing a sensitive information disclosure.
    This vulnerability have been assigned
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21233">CVE-2022-21233</a>.</p>
    <p>Intel recommends to enable x2APIC mode, which disables the xAPIC
    MMIO page and instead exposes APIC registers through model-specific
    registers (MSRs) to mitigate the issue.  Run
    <code>dmesg | grep 'x2apic'</code> to see if APIC is operating in
    x2APIC mode.  If the output contains "x2apic enabled", it indicates
    the APIC is already operating in x2APIC mode and no further action is
    needed.  If there is no output, enable <code>CONFIG_X86_X2APIC</code>
    in the kernel configuration and rebuild the kernel, then recheck after
    booting the new kernel.  If the output contains "x2apic is disabled
    because BIOS sets x2apic opt out bit", try to enable x2APIC in the BIOS
    setting.  If it's not possible, you'll need to update to at least

    <h4>11.1 082 Linux Kernel (LFS)  Date: 2022-04-24  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In Linux-5.18.14.3 (and 5.15.57) there are fixes for speculative
    vulnerabilities which might lead to information disclosure and have been
    named 'RETBleed'. There are actually two quite different sets of
    vulnerabilities, for AMD and Intel.</p>
    <p>This is particularly an issue for systems shared between multiple clients.
    The available mitigations vary. If you consider the threat is low, you
    might wish to disable the mitigations by passing 'retbleed=off'. Enabling the
    mitigations but not specifying a boot-time option will give you whatever
    'auto' means on that particular CPU. All of these mitigations cause some
    reduction in the I/O per second and tend to slow compilations. </p>
    <p>For AMD, this is
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29900">CVE-2022-29900</a>,
    which applies to Excavator, Zen1 and Zen2 processors.</p>
    <p>For Zen1 and earlier, also Hygon, the options are 'unret' or 'unret,nosmt'.
    The latter disables the SMT sibling cores, so in effect you only have half the
    number of CPUs. 'Unret' means replace all 'ret' instructions with
    'jmp __x86_return_thunk' on kernel entry. This is apparently not a total solution,
    an AMD advisory notes that selecting CONFIG_ZERO_CALL_USED_REGS in the kernel
    config may provide some strength in depth, but does not affect all possible
    vulnerable sites.</p>
    <p>For Zen2, the choices are 'auto' (same as 'unret', in this case it adds STIBP
    protection for SMT) or 'ibpb' (stronger protection, higher performance impact.</p>
    <p>For Intel, this is
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29901">CVE-2022-29901</a> for generations 6 to 8, and
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28693">CVE-2022-28693</a> for generations 9 to 12.
    Intel's recommended mitigation for Spectre v2 on generations 6 to 8
    (IBRS) was not initially followed in the kernel because of the
    performance impact. Now, 'auto' (or 'ibpb') selects IBRS and this is
    applied to generations 6 to 8 processors.  For processors from
    generation 9 to 12, enhanced IBRS (note that it's different from
    the "original" IBRS) has been used to mitigate Spectre v2 and it will
    be used to mitigate RETBleed too.</p>
    <p>If you need to fix these, update to at least linux-5.18.14 (or linux-5.15.57
    if you intend to stay on a long-term supported kernel) using the instructions
    from the LFS book for
    <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/11.2/chapter10/kernel.html">Linux Kernel (sysv)</a> or

    <h4>11.1 071 WebKitGTK+   Date: 2022-07-13  Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In WebKitGTK+-2.36.4, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for remote code execution and undesirable behavior. In the case of
    the undesirable behavior, it was found that video calls that use WebRTC
    could be interrupted if the audio capture was interrupted. In the case of
    the remote code execution vulnerability, processing maliciously crated web
    content can result in remote code execution - this was a use-after-free
    issue which was addressed with improved memory management.

    <p>In cURL-7.84.0, four security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for denial of service, unpreserved file permissions, and faulty
    message verification. The faulty message verification occurs when using the
    FTP protocol with Kerberos support. This flaw makes it possible to inject
    data into the data stream when downloading files due to improper
    verification. Note that FTP support with Kerberos combined very rarely
    used. The unpreserved file permissions vulnerability occurs due to
    accidentally widening permissions on files which are downloaded from
    cookies. Note that this can be worked around by using a strict umask.
    One of the denial of service vulnerabilities occurs when using HTTP
    compression due to a flaw in cURL's "chained" HTTP compression algorithm
    support. The number of acceptable "links" in the chain was unbounded,
    allowing for infinite amounts of memory to be used. The other
    denial-of-service vulnerability occurs when the Set-Cookie option is used
    in a HTTP header. A sufficient amount of cookies could cause cURL to deny
    all further cookies from any other websites.

    <h4>11.1 033 libinput  Date: 2022-04-21 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In libinput-1.20.1, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for arbitrary code execution due to a bug in the log handlers. When a device
    is detected by libinput and initialized, libinput will log several messages
    with log handlers setup by the calling functions. These log handlers will
    eventually result in a printf() call. Logging happens with the privileges
    of the caller - in some cases, that may be root, in other cases it'll occur
    with whatever the privileges of the current user are. The device name ends
    up being part of the format string, and a kernel device with
    printf-style format string placeholders can enable an attacker to run
    malicious code. An exploit is therefore possible through any device where
    the attacker can control the device name. A couple examples are /dev/uinput
    and Bluetooth devices. Upstream has noted that all versions of libinput since
    1.10 (released in February of 2018) are affected, and this affects any
    system that uses either X.org or Wayland, as well as the
    xf86-input-libinput X.org input driver.

    <p>In gzip-1.12, a security vulnerability was fixed that can allow for
    arbitrary file overwrite and command execution when using 'zgrep' on a
    crafted archive. Upstream says that it's relatively hard to exploit, but
    the BLFS team has independently confirmed that exploiting this vulnerability
    is trivial. This vulnerability is only exploitable when GNU Sed is in use,
    and it occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames
    with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names
    are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This would allow a remote

    <h4>11.1 026 libarchive   Date: 2022-04-12 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In libarchive-3.6.1, several security vulnerabilities were fixed that
    could allow for application crashes and arbitrary code execution.
    These occur in the 7zip reader, the ZIP reader, the ISO reader, and the
    RARv4 reader, as well as in the libarchive API. Note that these
    vulnerabilities have not been assigned CVEs, but are listed as security
    fixes by upstream. The primary attack vector for these vulnerabilties
    is API misuse in another application, with a malformed archive file also
    being a possibility.

    <h4>11.1 025 Subversion   Date: 2022-04-12 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In Subversion-1.14.2, two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for trivial denial-of-service and for arbitrary file paths to be
    read. In the case of the denial-of-service vulnerability, only servers
    that use mod_dav_svn in httpd are impacted. This occurs because mod_dav_svn
    servers will atempt to use memory which has already been freed, and
    subsequent attempts to access the same resource will immediately result in
    httpd crashing. However, in the case of the arbitrary file path read
    vulnerability, both standard svnserve servers are affected, as well as those
    which use the mod_dav_svn module in httpd. This vulnerability occurs due to
    an improper logging implementation, causing sensitive information to be
    reported even if the information is supposed to be omitted.

    <p>In BIND-9.18.1, four security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow
    for denial-of-service conditions (resource exhaustion due to infinite loops
    and unexpected crashes), and for DNS cache poisoning. In the case of DNS
    cache poisoning, it's possible for bogus NS records to be cached and used
    by named if it named needs to recurse for any reason, causing it to obtain
    and pass on incorrect records. This will cause the client-side cache to become
    poisoned with incorrect records, leading to queries being made to the wrong
    servers and thus resulting in false information being returned to clients.
    This could allow for cache poisoning and for clients to be redirected to
    malicious sites instead of the original website that they were attempting
    to access. Note that all four of these vulnerabilities are exploitable
    remotely, and one of them is only applicable to 32-bit systems.

    <h4>11.0 087 WebKitGTK+   Date: 2022-02-24  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In WebKitGTK+-2.34.6, a security vulnerability was fixed that allows
    for trivial remote code execution, and that requires no user interaction.
    This vulnerability has been rated as an emergency by Apple, and has
    resulted in out-of-band security updates for all of it's devices.
    Processing maliciously crafted images can result in trivial remote code
    execution, and Apple is aware of several reports that this issue is being
    actively exploited. This issue is classified as a use-after-free and was
    fixed in WebKitGTK+ with improved memory management. Due to the severity
    of this vulnerability and the fact that the vulnerability is being actively
    exploited, the BLFS team recommends updating to WebKitGTK+-2.34.6 immediately.

    <h4>11.0 086 Expat        Date: 2022-02-24  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In expat-2.4.5, several security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for remote code execution and denial of service. One of these
    vulnerabilities allows for remote code execution due to missing validation
    of UTF-8 characters, such as checks for whether a UTF-8 character is valid
    in a certain context. This could allow for the characters to be passed
    elsewhere in the stack, and lead to remote code execution. Another
    vulnerability exists that allows attackers to insert namespace-separator
    characters into namespace URIs, allowing for trivial remote code execution
    or unauthorized access to information. Another vulnerability exists in the
    build_model function that alows for a denial of service due to stack
    exhaustion (application crash). In the functions storeRawNames and
    copyString, integer overflow vulnerabilities exist that allow for remote
    code execution when processing XML files. Similar to the libxml2 and libxslt
    vulnerabilities, these can be exploited trivially through malicious
    advertisements and other crafted web content, but also through other means
    depending on the context of an application that uses these libraries.
    The BLFS team recommends updating to expat-2.4.6 as soon as possible.

    <p>In util-linux-2.37.4, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow
    for local attackers to read information that is normally accessible only by
    the 'root' user. This vulnerability exists in the 'chsh' and 'chfn'
    utilities when compiled with support for libreadline, which is the default
    in LFS. The readline library uses the INPUTRC environment variable to get
    a path to the user's input settings from /etc/inputrc, but when the library
    cannot parse the specified file, it prints an error containing data from
    the file. An example attacker is a user setting INPUTRC to /etc/passwd, and
    then running chsh (or any other setuid-root application). This flaw thus
    allows an unprivileged user to read root-owned files, which can lead to
    privilege escalation and unauthorized access to privileged information.

    <p>In Samba-4.15.3, three security vulnerabilities were fixed that could
    allow for an information leak, for trivial remote code execution, and for
    the ability to impersonate services on an Active Directory network. The
    information leak vulnerability occurs via symlinks, and can notify the user
    of the existence of a file or folder outside of an exported directory share.
    The remote code execution is trivial to exploit and allows remote attackers
    to easily execute arbitrary code as root on affected Samba servers which
    use the VFS module vfs_fruit. This vulnerability exists within the parsing
    of EA metadata when opening files in smbd. Note that vfs_fruit is most
    commonly used when an Apple Macintosh device is on the network. This
    particular vulnerability has been rated a 9.9/10 by NVD. The Active
    Directory impersonation vulnerability occurs due to checks being bypassed.
    These checks are supposed to prevent aliased SPNs from being mixed up with
    standard users. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by writing to an
    account that is identical to the name of an existing service. This also
    allows an attacker to intercept traffic intended for those services, allowing
    for a significant loss of confidentiality and integrity.

    <p>In gst-plugins-base-1.18.6 (and 1.20.0), a security vulnerability was
    fixed that could allow for application crashes when presented with malformed
    files. This occured when calling upon tagdemux during processing of a
    malicious MP3 file, and happens due to a race condition between typefinding
    and the end-of-stream event. This vulnerability can be exploited via
    WebKitGTK+-based browsers by visiting a web page with a corrupted MP3 file
    present on the page.

    <p>In zsh-5.8.1, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    malicious command execution through the PROMPT_SUBST expansion. An attacker
    can achieve code execution if they control a command output inside the

    <h4>11.0 069 glibc            Date: 2022-02-13  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In glibc-2.35, four security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow
    for denial of service, remote code execution, information disclosure,
    arbitrary code execution, and privilege escalation. One of these
    vulnerabilties occurs due to an off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow
    in the getcwd() function, which may lead to memory corruption when the
    size of the buffer is exactly '1'. A local attacker who has the capability
    of controlling the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a SUID-bit
    enabled program can use this flaw to elevate privileges and execute
    arbitrary code on the system. Another vulnerability is caused by the
    realpath() function - in applications which use the realpath_stk() function,
    it is possible to have unintentional information leakage and disclosure of
    sensitive data due to an unexpected value being returned with the contents
    of memory. Another vulnerability exists in the svcunix_create() function in
    the SunRPC module in glibc. This occurs when the svcunix_create() function
    copies its path argument on the stack without validating it's length, which
    results in a buffer overflow and remote code execution (or crashes). The
    fourth and final vulnerability exists in the clnt_create() function in the
    SunRPC module. The clnt_create function will copy it's hostname argument
    on the stack without validating it's length, which results in a buffer
    overflow and remote code execution or application crashes.

    <p>In systemd-249 (and systemd-250), a security vulnerability exists that
    allows for uncontrolled recursion in the systemd-tmpfiles program.
    systemd-tmpfiles creates, modifies, and deletes temporary files and

    as a denial-of-service, it is also possible to cause PID1 to Segmentation
    Fault when this is exploited. It is also possible to create arbitrary
    files if an attacker can catch a folder while it is still world-writable.
    If you use systemd, it is recommended that you patch your installation
    immediately. In response to this, the BLFS Editors have developed a patch
    for both version 250 (which is for the development books), and for 249
    (which is the version that shipped with LFS/BLFS 11.0).

    encryption in progress with a crashed (unfinished) reencryption step, which
    allows for persistent decryption of the device. If you are using cryptsetup

    <h4>11.0 048 Grilo         Date: 2021-01-10  Severity: Moderate</h4>
    <p>In Grilo-0.3.14, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    man-in-the-middle attacks and silent TLS encryption downgrades. This problem
    exists due to TLS certificate validation not being enabled on the
    SoupSessionAsync objects that grilo creates. This could also allow for
    commands and false data to be injected into a stream of data, depending on
    the context where Grilo is used. According to the National Vulnerability
    Database, this vulnerability can result in high confidentiality impact
    (information leakage), due to the silent TLS encryption downgrade.

    (on systems which are using SSH forwarding). All four of these
    vulnerabilities are classified as out-of-bounds access, and are due to
    improper input valiadtion. One of these vulnerabiilities exists in
    the Record extension, another in the ScreenSaver extension, another in
    XFixes, and the last in the Render extension (which handles fonts). Note
    that these security vulnerabilities were fixed in xorg-server as well,
    so you should install both updates.

    <p>In OpenJDK-17.0.1, there were several security vulnerabilities fixes
    that could allow for remote code execution, unauthorized modification of
    data, and denial of service. Some of these occured via malicious image

    also prevents exploitation of the log4j security vulnerability, known as
    Log4Shell. Log4Shell permits trivial remote-code-execution and is being
    exploited worldwide at an alarming rate. Most Java applications are affected
    because they use Apache's log4j logging framework. If you have Java

    <p>In PostgreSQL-14.1 (as well as 13.5, 12.9, 11.14, 10.19, and 9.6.24),
    two security vulnerabilities were fixed that could allow for both
    PostgreSQL Client and PostgreSQL Server to process unencrypted bytes
    from an unauthenticed remote attacker via a man-in-the-middle attack.
    This is caused by injecting false responses into PostgreSQL during initial

    injection of arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established.

    The arbitrary code execution vulnerability exists in the CGI gem, and occurs
    when large files are passed to CGI.escape_html due to a buffer overflow. The
    denial of service vulnerability happens when parsing dates using Date.parse().
    The content spoofing vulnerability occurs when using CGI::Cookie.parse. This
    is a resurgence of the CVE-2020-8184 vulnerability, which allows for attackers
    to modify cookies in transit and for them to be accepted by Ruby without going

    <h4>11.0 024 BIND9              Date: 2021-10-27 Severity: Medium</h4>
    <p>In versions of BIND prior to 9.16.22, a security vulnerability existed
    that could allow for remote attackers to cause a service degredation in
    BIND resolver performance by sending malformed packets to a server. This
    has to do with a feature called "lame cache", which is enabled by setting
    the 'lame-ttl' option in named.conf to a number greater than 0. The option
    is set to 600 in the default configuration, meaning that it's enabled by
    default. A successful attack results in the internal data structures for
    the lame cache growing infinitely, which results in a server burning most
    of it's CPU time on just maintaining the "lame cache", resulting in
    major slowdown and timeouts on client hosts. This vulnerability is
    exploitable remotely. To work around this, set 'lame-ttl 0' in named.conf.
    NOTE: Only the server is affected, you do not need to update if you are
    running the client utilities.

    <p>In Samba-4.15.1 (and Samba-4.14.9), a security vulnerability was fixed
    that could allow for an authenticaion bypass due to a flaw in the version

    <p>In Samba-4.17.0, a security vulnerability was fixed that could allow for
    a remote attacker to crash the Samba server process if the Active Directory
    Domain Controller was configured. This can occur due to a request to the

    <h4>11.0 010 WebKitGTK+    Updated: 2021-10-26   Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In WebKitGTK+-2.34.0, a critical 0day security
    vulnerability was fixed that allows for attackers to silently execute
    arbitrary code via maliciously crafted web content. In some cases, this
    may include advertisements embedded on normal web pages. There have been
    several reports over the past couple of days of this vulnerability being
    exploited in the wild to silently install malware on various Apple devices,
    and WebKitGTK+ is impacted because it uses Apple's WebKit. This
    vulnerability was fixed with improved memory management, and updating to
    the latest WebKit should be done without any delay due to it being actively
    exploited through advertisements on many web pages and through other means,
    such as malicious JPEG and PNG images. Exploitation is possible through the
    Epiphany web browser and through malicious emails in Evolution or Balsa.
    The vulnerability has been named "FORCEDENTRY".

    <h4>11.0 008 cURL          Date: 2021-09-22   Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In cURL before 7.79.0, three security vulnerabilities exist that could
    allow for a denial of service, security protocol downgrades (leading to
    disclosure of encrypted information), and malicious data injection. The
    denial of service vulnerability occurs when sending data to a MQTT server
    over the MQTT protocol, and that protocol is built into cURL by default.
    The protocol downgrade vulnerability affects POP3, FTP, and IMAP connections
    and occurs when a malicious server (or man-in-the-middle attacker) sends a
    properly crafted and legitimate response. The flaw makes cURL silently
    continue it's operations without encryption, contrary to the instructions
    passed to it as well as general expectations. The data injection
    vulnerability happens when using the STARTTLS protocol with IMAP, POP3,
    SMTP, or FTP. Multiple responses can be received prior to using STARTTLS
    to upgrade the connection to TLS, and cURL would process these out of
    cache and trust them instead of processing (and verifying) them after the
    TLS handshake was performed. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
    inject fake responses and trick cURL into sending malicious (or fake) data
    back to the user.

    <p>A vulnerability in the released version of glibc-2.34 has been
    discovered. This is remotely exploitable and can be used to crash
    programs linked to glibc. CVE-2021-38604 has been assigned, details at
    <a href="https://blog.tuxcare.com/cve/tuxcare-team-identifies-cve-2021-38604-a-new-vulnerability-in-glibc">tuxcare</a>
    and
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38604">CVE-2021-38604</a>.</p>

    <p>In the development book this unfixed vulnerability existed between 2021-08-02
    and 2021-08-20, it was also in LFS-11.0-rc1. It has been fixed with a sed in the
    chapter 8 glibc build.</p>

    <p>There is a test file at https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/~xry111/glibc-28213.c
    : compile that with 'gcc glibc-28213.c -o glibc-28213 -lrt' and run it. If that
    segfaults, your system is vulnerable.</p>

    <p>Some people will be happy to discard the vulnerable system and start over,
    but the system can be fixed. It is necessary to rebuild glibc, but because the
    API and ABI have not changed, only the following three files need to be updated:
    libc.a, libc.so.6, and libc.so.6.dbg (if you did strip the debug symbols).</p>

    <p>If you update these files, you should reboot as soon as possible afterwards.
    The system will not shutdown cleanly. After rebooting, recompile and rerun the
    test program to confirm it now ends normally.</p>

    <p>If you are going to fix the existing system, make a usable backup before
    you start (and check it can be applied in case things go wrong).</p>

    <p>One approach is to make a fresh LFS build to the end of chapter 8 using the
    modified instructions, then copy those 3 files to the running system.</p>

    <p>A more adventurous approach is to rebuild (only) glibc in the running system,
    using the modified instructions. But instead of installing it make a DESTDIR
    install followed by stripping and installing only those libraries (watch for
    any error messages)</p>

    <p>[code]<br/>
    make DESTDIR=/tmp/GLIBC install<br/>
    cd /tmp/GLIBC/usr/lib<br/>
    for LIB in libc.so.6 ; do<br/>

    <h4>10.1 081 systemd (LFS and BLFS) Date: 2021-07-23 Severity: High</h4>
    <p>In systemd-220 and later, a security vulnerability exists that could
    allow a local attacker to crash systemd, which then causes a kernel panic.
    This vulnerability is due to a flaw in the FUSE filesystem implementation,
    and requires the kernel to be upgraded as well, to either Linux-5.10.52 or
    Linux-5.13.4. systemd constantly monitors /proc/self/mountinfo, and when
    a file path longer than 8MB is discovered and parsed, systemd will crash
    with a segmentation fault. The security patch that is available will use
    a different string duplication function to prevent this crash from
    occuring. This primarily affects systems with FUSE filesystems, such as
    SSHFS or NTFS. However, FUSE is also used by XFCE and GNOME because of GVFS.
    This vulnerability is possible to exploit when automounting USB drives.
    Filesystem corruption is also possible due to the memory corruption that
    occurs when systemd crashes. A proof-of-concept exploit is also available
    in the wild.
    Due to the merged-/usr changes, upgrading to systemd-249 (with the patch)
    for non-SVN users is not advised. As a result, patches have been made
    that you can apply to your build tree and rebuild systemd with.
    These patches have been made available for LFS 10.0 (246) and LFS 10.1 (247).
    This vulnerability affects all systems that run systemd-220 or higher.
    This vulnerability has been assigned
    <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-33910">CVE-2021-33910</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are running LFS git, you can update to systemd-249 with the patch
    using the instructions in the <em>BLFS</em> book for
    <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/11.0-systemd/general/systemd.html">systemd (systemd)</a>.
    You must also upgrade your kernel to Linux-5.13.4 or later.</p>
    <p>If you are running LFS 10.1, you can apply the patch from
    <a href="https://linuxfromscratch.org/patches/downloads/systemd/systemd-247-security_fixes-1.patch">systemd-247-security_fixes-1.patch</a>
    to your build tree after applying the other systemd-247 patches and rebuild
    systemd. You must then upgrade your kernel to Linux-5.10.52 or later.</p>

    <p>In Binutils-2.37, four security vulnerabilties were fixed. One of
    these vulnerabilities allows for arbitrary filesystem access due to a
    race condition in ar, objcopy, strip and ranlib. When these utilities
    are being run by a privileged user, an unprivileged user can trick them
    into getting ownership of arbitrary files on the filesystem through a
    symbolic link. An additional security vulnerability exists in
    GNU libiberty, which can result in a crash due to an infinite loop.
    Two more vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary code execution and memory
    corruption due to a stack based buffer overflow, or an out-of-bounds
    write. These vulnerabilities apply to objdump and libiberty. These
    vulnerabilities cannot be exploited remotely.

    <h4>10.1 079 cURL      Date: 2021-07-23 Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>In cURL-7.78.0, four security vulnerabilities were fixed. The first
    vulnerability will allow malicious content to be stored on disk instead
    of discarded when using the metalink feature, because the information is
    not checked against the XML file that contains the hash for the file
    correctly. Another security vulnerability in the metalink feature
    will send login credentials in plaintext and pass them on to any server
    that cURL connects to for a metalink download. Another security
    vulnerability exists in the way that cURL keeps previous connections
    stored for use again. Due to a flaw in the logic that handles path name
    checks, the comparison did not take security certificates into account,
    and also compared the involved paths case insensitively. This will result
    in a certificate store bypass as well as the potential of connecting to
    a compromised server. Another TELNET stack content disclosure vulnerability
    was fixed, caused by the fix for CVE-2021-22898 in cURL-7.78.0. This could
    result in keystrokes, including passwords, being leaked to remote attackers
    during a TELNET session.

    not raise an exception when a STARTTLS connection fails with an unknown response.
    This would allow man-in-the-middle attacks to occur, as well as bypasses
    of the TLS protections. The third vulnerability is rated High, and is a
    command injection vulnerability in the RDoc command. When using the RDoc
    command, if a file name starts with a pipe ("|"), and ends with a tag,
    the command following the pipe character will be executed. A malicious
    Ruby project could thus exploit it to run arbitrary commands against a user
    who attempts to use the RDoc command. It is recommended to update Ruby
    as soon as possible.

    <p>In Linux 5.12.10 and earlier, several security vulnerabilities existed
    in the Bluetooth, Xen (virtualization), and wireless networking stacks.
    The Bluetooth vulnerability can allow for denial of service by allowing
    a local user to cause a kernel panic by attaching a malicious HCI TTY
    Bluetooth device. The Xen vulnerability can allow for the network adapter
    on the host system to fail due to a driver crash in the kernel. This
    vulnerability can be exploited through a virtual machine running on
    the system. The wireless stack vulnerabilities impact all cards and
    could allow for decryption of encrypted packets sent over Wi-Fi Protected
    Access (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) packets due to
    a protocol issue that does not require all fragments in a frame to be
    signed by a single key. Another vulnerability in the ath11k wireless driver
    can allow for an attacker to inject and decrypt packets in a connection
    that uses WPA or WPA2 with the TKIP data-confidentiality protocol. Another
    vulnerability in the ath10k driver allows for a remote attacker to
    inject arbitrary packets since the plaintext QoS header in a packet is not
    required to be authenticated under thw WPA, WPA2, WPA3, or WEP standard. 
    Another vulnerability in the wireless stack allows for arbitrary network
    packets to be injected and for the exfiltration of user data regardless of
    whether any encryption is in place, and fragments are not cleared from memory
    after reconnecting to a network.

    <p>In Samba-4.14.4, a security vulnerability was fixed that allows for
    users to have unauthorized access to information, as well as the ability
    for users to modify/delete files from shares that they should not have
    access to. The underlying cause of this vulnerability is an out-of-bounds
    read that sometimes occurs when mapping Windows group identities (SIDs) into
    Unix group IDs (gids). The code that handles this could read data beyond
    the end of an array in the case that a negative cache entry had been added
    to the cache. This would then cause the conversion code to return those
    values into the process token that stores the group membership of a user.
    This vulnerability was originally spotted at Linkoping University, where
    a user was found deleting files from a network share that they were not
    supposed to have access to. If you are using the Samba file server to share
    files, it is suggested that you update immediately. Other impacts include

    <h4>10.1 041 Rustc  Date: 2021-05-11  Severity: Critical</h4>
    <p>Eight vulnerabilities have been found in the rust standard library before
    1.52.0, or in crates which use it. One of the critical CVEs was raised as
    'before 1.53.0', but the fix has been backported to 1.52.0.</p>
    <p>For the general case (where static libraries are used and a variety of
    crates might be built) the advice is to update both rust and all the packages
    which use it.</p>
    <p>For BLFS with its limited number of crates which use rust, it can be shown
    (e.g. by removing the /opt/rustc symlink) that the built programs do not use
    the standard library at runtime), and therefore the vulnerabilities are
    assumed to have been at compile time. Nevertheless, the incorrect code has
    been available and it may be that the resulting programs can do incorrect
    things. The safest advice is to update rust and then rebuild (or update) all
    the packages which use it.</p>

    <p>In OpenSSH-8.6p1, a security vulnerability was fixed that was introduced
    in version 8.5p1 with the addition of the LogVerbose keywords. When this
    option was enabled with a set of patterns that activated logging in code
    that runs in the lower-privileged/sandboxed sshd process, the log messages
    were constructed in a way that printf(3) format strings could effectively
    be specified in the lower-privelged code. As a result, an attacker who had
    successfully exploited the lower-privileged process could use the logging
    feature to escape the sandbox and attack the higher-priveleged process.

    sequences of semicolons in RFC822 fields, causing large memory consumption.
